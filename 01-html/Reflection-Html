Reflection:
Working on these HTML exercises gave me a better understanding of how different elements help build the structure of a web page.
Lists helped me organize content clearly, especially when working with unordered and ordered lists. It was cool to see how small changes in tags (<ul> vs <ol>) made the layout feel more intentional and organized.
Images were fun to play with. I learned how to add them using the <img> tag and how important it is to include alt text for accessibility. It was also interesting to adjust image sizes and see how they affect the layout.
Tables were a bit more challenging at first, but I eventually got the hang of how rows (<tr>) and cells (<td>, <th>) work together. Theyâ€™re super useful for displaying structured data.
Forms were probably the most complex so far, but also the most interactive. I liked learning how to collect user input with elements
