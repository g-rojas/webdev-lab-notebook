Refleciton: 
In this exercise, I worked on fixing accessibility issues in a starter HTML form. The main goal was to make the form more usable and readable for all users, including those using screen readers or assistive technology.
I started by identifying problems using WAVE and Lighthouse accessibility audits.  me of the key improvements I made included:
putting alt text for images, Adding or correcting <label> tags for every input field, using the for attribute to match the input’s id.
Making sure placeholder text wasn’t the only way to describe an input’s purpose. Fixing color contrast issues to improve visibility.
