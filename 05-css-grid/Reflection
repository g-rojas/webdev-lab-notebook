Working with CSS Grid gave me a deeper understanding of how to build complex, 
structured layouts in a much more organized way. 
Unlike Flexbox, which is great for one-dimensional layouts (row or column), 
Grid let me control both rows and columns at the same time.
I practiced using properties like grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, and gap,
which helped me create clean, responsive layouts without relying on floats or extra containers. 
I also experimented with grid-area and grid-template-areas,
which made naming and positioning sections feel a lot more readable.
