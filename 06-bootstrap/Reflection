Learning Bootstrap helped me see how much faster and easier it can be to build clean,
responsive web pages without writing all the CSS from scratch. 
I practiced using its built-in classes for layout, spacing, buttons, forms, and components I
also appreciated how Bootstrap's utility classes let me quickly adjust things like padding, margins, text alignment, 
and colors just by adding class names. It made styling feel more efficient and less repetitive.
